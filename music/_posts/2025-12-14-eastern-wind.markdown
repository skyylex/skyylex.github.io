An instrumental single inspired by Eastern sounds.

This track represents a humble attempt to incorporate eastern vibe into a sad slow tempo beat using minimalistic approach (only 4 instruments).

Gear used: 
- Reaper (DAW)
- Arturia Pigments (VSTi, synthesized Koto sounds)
- Arturia Pigments (VSTi, synthesized Strings & Winds sounds)
- Native Instruments Komplete (YANGQIN, chinese strings instrument sampler)
- Steven Slate Drums (VSTi, drum sounds)
- Native Instruments Komplete S49 MKII (midi-keyboard)
