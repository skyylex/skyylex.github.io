A minimalistic instrumental single defined by mix of a piano and a synth chaos.

In this track I looked for a way to integrate the beauty of the piano sounds with a booming synth bass and a chaotical synth vibe. The differences of the instruments are defined in a way to show the chaotical nature of thoughts.

Gear used: 
- Reaper (DAW)
- Arturia Pigments (VSTi, synth sounds)
- Numa Player (VSTi, synth sounds)
- Steven Slate Drums (VSTi, drum sounds)
- Native Instruments Komplete S49 MKII (midi-keyboard)
