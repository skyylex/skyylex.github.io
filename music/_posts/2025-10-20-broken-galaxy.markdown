A synth-driven journey through dark space.

This instrumental track was inspired by the hanging dissonances produced by one of synthesizers—tones that felt like a spacecraft traveling through the cracks of time and space.

Gear used: 
- Reaper (DAW)
- Arturia Pigments (VSTi, synth sounds)
- Steven Slate Drums (VSTi, drum sounds)
- Fractal Audio AX8 (guitar processor)
- Schecter Extreme Passive 6 (electric guitar)
- Native Instruments Komplete S49 MKII (midi-keyboard)
